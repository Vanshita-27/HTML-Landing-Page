Approach:
In this project, I created a simple Landing Page for a "Teddy Bear" product, incorporating various sections to display relevant content, such as the product description, features, pricing, and a call-to-action. Here's a breakdown of the steps I followed, challenges I faced, and how I structured the content:
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Steps Followed:
Set Up Basic HTML Structure: I started by creating the basic structure of an HTML document with the <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags. I set the character encoding to UTF-8 and made the page responsive by setting the viewport meta tag.
Added Header Section: I used the <section> tag to group the content related to the product, starting with a heading (<h1>) for the product title ("Teddy Bear"). I added an image with the <img> tag to visually represent the product and a brief description with a <p> tag.
Features Section: I created another section to list the features of the teddy bear. I used the <ul> (unordered list) and <li> (list item) tags to present the features in a structured way. I also used the <u> tag to underline the feature titles.
Pricing Section: I structured the pricing details using <p> tags, displaying the original price with a strikethrough using <s>, and the discounted price in bold using <b>. I also added a savings offer.
Call-to-Action (CTA) Section: I included a "Buy Now" button with the <button> tag to prompt the user to take action. I left it non-functional for now but it can be linked to an actual checkout page later.
Navigation Bar: A <nav> section was added to create navigation links to the Home, Features, and Pricing sections. These links are placeholders for now, but they can be linked to specific sections later.
Footer Section: The footer contains copyright information (©2024 Vanshita Agrawal), which I used the <footer> tag to wrap.

Challenges Faced:
Button and Links: I had to decide how to handle the "Buy Now" button. Initially, it was simply a static button with no functionality. I kept it basic for now, but it can be enhanced later with JavaScript or linked to a checkout page.
Layout Design: As this is a simple page without complex styles, the design challenges were minimal. However, ensuring proper spacing and alignment of sections was important for readability.

Content Structure:
Logical Grouping: I grouped related content in sections: one for the product introduction, another for features, one for pricing, and a final one for the call-to-action and navigation.
Headings and Text: I used <h1>, <h2>, and <p> tags to organize the content into clear sections and make it more readable for users.
Lists: The product features were structured in a list format using <ul> and <li> tags, making the content easy to read and digest.

Learning:
From this exercise, I gained valuable insights into various HTML tags and concepts:
Use of <section>: This tag is great for logically grouping content. It helped me organize the different sections of the webpage (e.g., Features, Pricing, and Footer).
Using <ul> and <li>: These tags helped me present the features of the product in an easy-to-read list format, making the page more structured.
<s> and <b> Tags: I used the <s> tag to show the original price with a strikethrough and the <b> tag to highlight the discounted price in bold.
Navigation (<nav>): I learned how to use the <nav> tag to group navigation links together. Though I used placeholder links for now, this will be helpful for adding functional navigation later.
Footer (<footer>): I used the <footer> tag to wrap the copyright information, understanding its importance in marking the footer content.
Inline Styling: While I didn’t dive into external CSS for styling, I learned that inline styles like style="background-color: rgb(172, 255, 227);" can be used for simple customizations.
